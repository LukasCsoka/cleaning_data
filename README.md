# cleaning_data

This is a repository for Coursera.org course Getting and Cleaning Data. 

In the repository are three files:

1. README.md containing this text
2. run_analysis.R script, that cleans the data and outputs two final files.
3. codebook.md containg code book for the script

Steps to reproduce:

1. Need the unzipped data set from the link - https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Place the unzipped folder into the same directory as that of the R script file and run the script run_analysis.R .
